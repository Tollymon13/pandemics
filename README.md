## Introduction
This problem models the spread of a disease within a population, following the theme of the Covid19 pandemic.
Given a population of N people, they can be sub grouped into three different groups:
- S, people who are susceptible to the disease,
- I, people who have the disease and,
- R, people who have recovered of and are removed from the diseased group.
The total population size should equal N, N=S+I+R. 

## The SIR Model
An SIR model is modelling process using ordinary differential equations. The model predicts how the disease will spread by accounting for the number of infected, the duration of the epidemic and the reproductive number. Real world applications of this model can be seen in epidemics. For instance, Public Health Services can derive efficient ways to issue vaccines within a population.

In this problem a script is made to implement a model of the spread of the COVID-19 virus. Through several precautionary methods such as social distancing and vaccinations the model of the spreading of the disease can be flattened, reducing the spread of the virus.  
This reduction can be observed by looking at the three sub-populations and how they interact with each other.
